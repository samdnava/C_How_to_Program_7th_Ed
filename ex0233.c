// 2.33 (Car-Pool Savings Calculator)
// Research several car-pooling websites.
// Create an application that calculates your daily driving cost,
// so that you can estimate how much money could be saved by car pooling,
// which also has other advantages such as reducing carbon emissions and reducing traffic congestion.
// The application should input the following information and display the userâ€™s cost per day of driving to work:
// a) Total miles driven per day.
// b) Cost per gallon of gasoline.
// c) Average miles per gallon.
// d) Parking fees per day.
// e) Tolls per day.
