// Distinguish between the terms fatal error and nonfatal error. 
// Why might you prefer to experience a fatal error rather than a nonfatal error?

// Fatal errors are blatant, they will cause the program to terminate right away and the shell will give you the erroneous line making it easier to know there is a mistake.
// Nonfatal errors allow the program to completion, so finding the error takes longer since it means you have to look for it because the shell would not know there is anything wrong as it thinks the program finished like normal.
